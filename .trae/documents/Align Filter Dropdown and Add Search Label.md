I will align the Filter Dropdown to match the design of the Menu Categories and add a label to the search bar as requested.

**Key Changes:**

1. **Filter Dropdown Alignment**: I will move the "Filter Dropdown" from being right-aligned (`justify-end`) to `justify-between` or similar, ensuring it aligns nicely with the category headers or the general flow. The user asked to "Align The dropdown to the menu category," which likely means making it sit flush left or aligning it with the section headers. I'll make it left-aligned to match the category titles.
2. **Search Bar Label**: I will add a clear `<label>` or helper text above the search input so users know exactly what it searches (e.g., "Search Menu & Packages").

**File to Edit:** `src/app/dashboard/catering/page.tsx`
**Action:**

* Update the search bar container to include a label.

* Update the Filter Dropdown container class to align it correctly.
